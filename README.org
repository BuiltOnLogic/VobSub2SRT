VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert =.idx= / =.sub= subtitles
into =.srt= text subtitles by using OCR.  It is based on code from the
[[http://www.mplayerhq.hu][MPlayer project]] - a really really great movie player.  Some minor parts are
 copied from [[http://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg/avutil]] headers. [[http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/][Tesseract]] is used as OCR software.

Maintained by Christopher Ogloff

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The MPlayer code included is
GPL2+ licensed.

The quality of the OCR depends on the text in the subtitles. Currently the code
does not use any preprocessing.  But I'm currently looking into adding filters
and scaling options to improve the OCR. You can try adjusting --min-width and
--min-height, or --y-threshold. Otherwise correct mistakes in the =.srt=
files with a text editor or a special subtitle editor.

*** Branch notes:
**legacy:
This branch will likely get less attention than master. Bugs (or more of them) may be here.

- Debian GNU/Linux 5 "Lenny" (fully updated final point release, details slipped my mind)
- Debian GNU/Linux 6.0.10 "Squeeze"
- Fedora 40 (why it doesn't work with master is beyond me at the moment.)


**master 

- Arch Linux
- Fedora 38-39 (Fedora 39 requires cmake downgrade to 3.27 if using 3.30)
- Debian 9-14

* Building
You will need Tesseract, CMake 2.6.0+ (legacy, CMake 3.5 for master) and
GCC 4.3+ (legacy, tested with GCC 15.2.1 on master) to build it, as well as a few imaging libraries.
On a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies with:

Note: Substitute libtiff-dev with libtiff4(or 5, etc)-dev if the package is not found!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-dev libtiff-dev tesseract-ocr-eng build-essential cmake pkg-config libleptonica-dev
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should also install the tesseract data for the languages you want to use!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-deu tesseract-ocr-nor tesseract-ocr-fra
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that support for tesseract below version 2.4 is deprecated and may not work.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

This should install the program vobsub2srt to =/usr/local/bin=.  You can
uninstall vobsub2srt with =sudo make uninstall=.

** Static binary
I recommend using the dynamic binary! However if you really need a static binary
you can add the flag =-DBUILD_STATIC=ON= to the =./configure= call.  But be
aware that building static binaries can be quite troublesome. You need the
static library files for tesseract, libtill, libavutils, and for their
dependencies as well.  On Ubuntu 12.04 the static libraries are only included in
the dev packages! You may also need the Gold linker.

For Debian you need the following extra packages, save binutils-gold for a possible edge scenario:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev libwebp-dev libgif-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev binutils-gold
#+END_EXAMPLE

If it exits cleanly but produces no text, you need to specify an IFO file.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vobsub2srt --ifo <IFO-file-path> <subfile-withoutextension>
#+END_EXAMPLE
and/or a language (--lang <lang>) if your DVD has undefined language metadata (most are like this).

Work needs to be done for auto-detection.

If linking fails with undefined references then checking what other dependencies
your version of leptonica has is a good starting point. You can do this by
running =ldd /usr/lib/liblept.so= (or whatever the path to leptonica is on your
system). Add those dependencies to =CMakeModules/FindTesseract.cmake=.

** Ubuntu PPA and .deb packages
*NOTE: This PPA has not been updated since 2013*

I have created a [[https://launchpad.net/~ruediger-c-plusplus/+archive/vobsub2srt][PPA (Personal Package Archive)]] to make installation on
Ubuntu easy.  Simply add the PPA to your apt-get sources and run an update and
you can install the =vobsub2srt= package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ruediger-c-plusplus/vobsub2srt
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install vobsub2srt
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** .deb (Debian/Ubuntu)
You can build a *.deb package (Debian and its derivatives) with =make package=.  The package
is created in the =build= directory.

You can also create a source package and upload it to your own PPA by using the
=UploadPPA.cmake=. But this is only recommended for people experienced with
cmake and creating Debian packages.

** Homebrew
Vobsub2srt contains a formula for [[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/][Homebrew]] (a package manager for OS X).  It can
be installed by using the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  brew install --with-all-languages tesseract
  brew install --HEAD https://github.com/BuiltOnLogic/VobSub2SRT/raw/master/packaging/vobsub2srt.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Gentoo ebuild
An [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebuild][ebuild]] for Gentoo Linux is also available.  You can make it available to
emerge with the following steps

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/media-video/vobsub2srt/
  wget https://github.com/BuiltOnLogic/VobSub2SRT/raw/master/packaging/vobsub2srt-9999.ebuild
  sudo mv vobsub2srt-9999.ebuild /usr/local/portage/media-video/vobsub2srt/
  cd /usr/local/portage/media-video/vobsub2srt/
  sudo ebuild vobsub2srt-999.ebuild digest
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should be able to install vobsub2srt with =emerge vobsub2srt= now.  If you
want to use a newer version (3+) of tesseract you have to use layman.
See [[https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/issues/13][#13]] for details.
** Arch AUR
There also exist a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD][PKGBUILD]] file for Arch Linux in AUR:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vobsub2srt-git
* Usage
vobsub2srt converts subtitles in VobSub (=.idx= / =.sub=) format into subtitles
in =.srt= format.  VobSub subtitles consist of two or three files called
=Filename.idx=, =Filename.sub= and optional =Filename.ifo=. To convert subtitles
simply call

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ vobsub2srt Filename
    Wrote subtitles to 'Filename.srt'
  $
#+END_EXAMPLE

with =Filename= being the file name of the subtitle files *WITHOUT* the
extension (=.idx= / =.sub=). vobsub2srt writes the subtitles to a file called
=Filename.srt=.

If a subtitle file contains more than one language you can use the =--lang=
parameter to set the correct language (Use =--langlist= to find out about the
languages in the file).  For some languages you might need to set the tesseract
language yourself (e.g., chi_tra/chi_sim for traditional or simplified chinese
characters).  You can use =--tesseract-lang= to do this.  In most cases this
should however be autodetected.

If you want to dump the subtitles as images (e.g. to check for correct ocr) you
can use the =--dump-images= flag.

Use =--help= or read the manpage to get more information about the options of
vobsub2srt.

If you have problems with a specific subtitle file then please check if
it works in a video player first.

For bug reports please run =vobsub2srt= with the =--verbose= and =--debug=
